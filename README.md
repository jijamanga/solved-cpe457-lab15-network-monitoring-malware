<strong>Lab Description: </strong>The goal of this lab is to analyze network behavior using dynamic analysis tools.

<strong>Lab Environment: </strong>Use of variety of tools is needed for this lab. It is recommended to do this lab in a virtualized environment.  The tools we will be using are:

<ul>

 <li>ApateDNS</li>

 <li>Wireshark</li>

 <li>Process Monitor (ProcMon)</li>

 <li>Text editor</li>

</ul>

<strong>Lab Files that are Needed:</strong>

<ul>

 <li>exe</li>

 <li>Word-dropper.zip</li>

 <li>pcap</li>

</ul>

<h3><strong>Lab Exercise 1 – Using Wireshark to perform Live collection</strong></h3>

<em>Learning Outcomes 1, 2, &amp; 3</em>

Using both <em>ApateDNS</em> and <em>WireShark</em>, capture the DNS requests made by domain_generation.exe and answer the following questions:

<ol>

 <li>How many domains were generated?</li>

 <li>Is there a discernible pattern to the domains used?</li>

 <li>Did they change with each run of the program or were the domains consistent?</li>

</ol>




<strong>LAB EXERCISE 2 – Using Wireshark to Analyze a PCAP</strong>

<em>Learning Outcomes 1, 2, &amp; 3</em>

The purpose of this part is to understand the behavior of malware based on its network activity.  Answer the following questions by providing short answers and/or screen shots.




<strong>Task 1 – Use CryptoLocker.pcap</strong>




<ul>

 <li>What domains do you think the malware tried to connect to (how many, roughly)?</li>

 <li>Look up some of the IP addresses that were resolved using this service <a href="https://ipinfo.io/">https://ipinfo.io/</a> (or any you prefer) – did you notice any trends in the IPs used?</li>

 <li>What happens when the sample can connect to a host?</li>

 <li>Does it appear that the sample was able to successfully connect to any host? Hint, see the DNS query number 808 and the resulting TCP stream</li>

</ul>







<strong>Task 2 – Use Word-Dropper.pcap</strong>




This capture came after opening a malicious Word Document.




<ul>

 <li>What domains were used?</li>

 <li>What happened after the domains tried to connect? What did the sample request and how did it request it?</li>

 <li>Do you think the sample was successful in infecting the host?</li>

</ul>
